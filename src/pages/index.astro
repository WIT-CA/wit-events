      Thank you for your support of Women in Technology of Central Arkansas. Our leadership team has made the difficult decision to step down, and the group will no longer continue under our direction. Existing members should be hearing from the national organization soon regarding the future of the group. We’re proud of the community we’ve built and hope to support new opportunities for women in tech in the future.
